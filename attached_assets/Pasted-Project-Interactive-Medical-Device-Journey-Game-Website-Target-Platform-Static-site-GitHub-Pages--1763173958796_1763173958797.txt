Project: Interactive Medical Device Journey Game Website
Target Platform: Static site (GitHub Pages)
Agent Environment: Replit AI agent (you are the developer + project manager)

1. Your Role & Overall Objective
You are an AI coding agent running in Replit.
Your job is to design, build, and ship a fully working, static website that feels like:

A narrative game / journey through the evolution of medical device technology
(from early tools to today’s AI-driven devices and speculative future tech)

The final deliverable must be:


Visually stunning, “next-generation” and creative


Interactive and gamified, not just a scrolling article


Fully static and deployable on GitHub Pages via a GitHub repository



2. Tech Stack & Project Setup
You must:


Use a static front-end stack compatible with GitHub Pages:


Option A: Vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript (modular JS)


Option B: React + Vite (or similar) with a static export, producing a final dist folder




No backend services or databases.


All state is handled client-side (JavaScript, localStorage, etc.)




Repository setup:


Initialize a Git repository in Replit.


Create a clear project structure (see Section 10).


Connect to GitHub.


Push the code to a new public repo (name suggestion: medical-device-journey-game).




GitHub Pages compatibility:


Ensure final compiled/static files are served from:


Either the root (/) of the main branch


Or a /docs folder




Confirm that all asset paths are relative and work on GitHub Pages.





3. High-Level Concept & Tone
Design the experience as an immersive journey with game-like elements:


The user is a “Time-Traveling Bioengineer” guided by an in-universe AI assistant.


They travel across eras of medical device innovation, making choices, solving small challenges, and unlocking content.


The tone:


Curious, futuristic, playful but accurate


Emphasize engineering, problem-solving, and patient impact.





4. Core Features & Game Mechanics
4.1 Narrative Structure (Eras / Levels)
Create at least 5 core eras, each treated like a “level”:


Foundations Era – Early diagnostics and tools


Examples: stethoscope, X-ray, basic prosthetics




Implantables Era – Pacemakers & life-sustaining devices


Focus: cardiac pacemakers, early implanted devices




Imaging & Robotics Era


MRI/CT, surgical robots, endoscopy




Wearables & Home Monitoring Era


Insulin pumps, CGMs, wearables, smart inhalers




AI & Future Era


AI-driven decision support, smart implants, closed-loop systems, speculative near-future concepts




For each era:


Short intro cinematic-style text (e.g., animated typewriter effect).


A core “mission” (small interactive task).


Key device cards (see 4.3).


Ethical or design question with user choice.


4.2 Progression & State
Implement a simple progression system:


Track which eras are unlocked/completed.


Use localStorage to remember progress between visits.


Unlock later eras only after completing earlier ones (configurable).


Visualize progress:


A timeline or stellar map where completed eras glow or change style.


A “completion %” indicator.


4.3 Interactive Device Cards
For each era, define at least 3 device “cards”:
Each device card should:


Show device name, era, and category (diagnostic, therapeutic, monitoring, etc.).


On click, expand into:


Very short story / problem it solves


Core engineering concept(s) (high-level)


Risk/Ethical consideration (brief)


Fun small interaction (example):


Slider comparing “before vs after” patient outcome


Toggle to see failure modes vs mitigations


Mini diagram with hover tooltips






4.4 Game-like Interactions
Include at least 3 distinct, reusable interaction types, for example:


Choice-based scenarios


The user picks a design decision (e.g., maximize battery life vs device size); show different outcomes.




Puzzle or sequencing mini-game


E.g., drag-and-drop the steps of device development (concept → prototyping → bench testing → clinical trials → post-market surveillance).




Simulation-lite slider


A slider controlling a parameter (like flow rate or insulin delivery) to keep a “virtual patient” in a safe range.




All of these must be implementable with front-end JS only.

5. Pages / Screens & Navigation
5.1 Landing Screen


Visual: Cosmic / futuristic lab interface with a central “portal” or “time engine.”


Elements:


Title (e.g., “Chronicles of the Machine: A Journey Through Medical Devices”).


One-sentence pitch.


“Begin Journey” primary CTA button.


“Skip to Timeline” secondary CTA.




5.2 Hub / Timeline Screen


A map of eras (horizontal timeline, or orbiting planets, or vertical “neural spine” of eras).


Each era represented by:


Icon + name.


Locked/unlocked state.




Clicking an era opens that era’s “Level Screen.”


5.3 Era Level Screen (Template)
All eras share the same layout template with different data:


Animated intro text section.


Device card grid.


One core interactive “mission.”


A reflection question or choice.


A “Continue / back to map” button.


5.4 Lab / Sandbox Screen (Optional but Preferred)


A special screen where users:


Mix different “tech building blocks” (e.g., sensor + actuator + algorithm) to get a fictional device.


Display a fun generated name and short blurb for that combo.




5.5 About & Credits


Brief “about this project” text.


Credit the concept as created for an interactive learning experience about medical devices.


No personal contact info required unless added by the user later (leave placeholder).



6. Visual Design & UX Requirements


Overall Feel:


Futuristic, UI-like interface


Subtle gradients, glows, and layering.


Use a consistent design system (spacing, font sizes, radius, shadows).




Theme:


Default to dark mode with high-contrast text.


Consider a subtle accent color palette (e.g., teal, purple, cyan) but keep accessibility in mind.




Responsiveness:


Fully responsive for:


Mobile (narrow phones)


Tablets


Desktop




Use flexbox/grid layouts.




Accessibility:


Semantic HTML (proper headings, landmark elements).


Keyboard navigable for all interactive elements.


Sufficient color contrast.


ARIA labels where needed (especially on custom components).




Animations & Motion:


Use CSS transitions / keyframes and/or lightweight JS.


Include:


Smooth section transitions.


Hover effects on cards.


A small parallax or scroll-based motion for the timeline (but not janky).




Make motion optional or subtle enough not to overwhelm.





7. Content Requirements
You may fabricate content as long as it is plausible and respectful, and framed clearly as educational/fictional.
For each era:


Intro paragraph (2–4 sentences) describing the context.


At least 3 devices with:


Name (real or realistic).


One-sentence description.


Short “Why it mattered” snippet.




One high-level engineering insight, e.g.:


Signal processing, closed-loop control, biocompatibility, safety margins.




One ethical question per era, with two or more choices.


No medical advice, claims of cure, or instructions for real-life use.

8. Implementation Details
8.1 Structure & Components
If using vanilla JS:


Organize code into modules:


data/eras.js – era and device definitions.


components/ – functions that render HTML strings or DOM nodes.


state/ – progression and localStorage logic.




If using React:


Suggested component structure:


<App />


<Landing />


<Timeline />


<EraView />


<DeviceCard />


<InteractionChoice />


<ProgressBar />


<LabSandbox />




Maintain global state via React hooks; persist key state to localStorage.


8.2 State & Storage


Use localStorage keys like:


mdj_progress (stores completed eras and current era).




On load, hydrate UI from stored state.


8.3 No External API Dependencies


All content and logic must be self-contained, without calling remote APIs.


Local assets (images, SVGs, icons) should be stored in the repo.



9. Performance, SEO & Code Quality


Performance:


Optimize images (use modern formats, reasonable resolutions).


Avoid heavy libraries unless truly beneficial.


Minify/optimize production build.




SEO Basics:


<title>, <meta name="description">.


Meaningful <h1>, <h2>, etc.


Descriptive alt text for images.




Code Quality:


Clean, well-commented code.


No dead/unreferenced files.


Use consistent naming conventions.





10. Repository Structure
Suggested structure (adapt if using a framework):
For vanilla HTML/CSS/JS:


/index.html


/assets/


/images/


/icons/




/css/


styles.css




/js/


main.js


data.js


state.js


components/ (if desired)




/README.md


For React + Vite (or similar):


/index.html (or framework equivalent)


/src/


main.jsx or main.tsx


App.jsx


components/


data/


styles/




/public/ for static assets


Build output directory (/dist) configured for Pages


Ensure the deployed version on GitHub Pages serves the fully working site.

11. GitHub Pages Deployment Tasks
You must:


Create and push to GitHub repo from Replit.


Configure GitHub Pages:


Source: main branch, root or /docs (or gh-pages branch if using a deploy script).




Ensure:


index.html is at the correct path.


All asset paths work in the GitHub Pages environment.




Update the README.md with:


Project description.


Live URL (GitHub Pages link).


Basic “how to run locally” instructions.





12. Final Deliverables Checklist
Before you consider the project complete, verify that:


 The site is live on GitHub Pages and fully functional.


 Landing → Timeline → Era views → Interactions all work.


 Progress persists via localStorage.


 At least 5 eras are implemented with device cards and interactions.


 At least 3 distinct interactive mechanics exist (choices, puzzle, slider/sim, etc.).


 The site is responsive (tested on mobile and desktop viewports).


 Dark theme, animations, and visuals match a futuristic, “out-of-this-world” experience.


 Code is organized and readable.


 README includes instructions and live link.



If you (the AI agent) need to make assumptions, do so in a way that:


Keeps the site educational, engaging, and respectful.


Keeps everything static and GitHub Pages–friendly.


Maximizes creativity and interactivity within these constraints.
